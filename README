ISSUES

* help pages for for common methods, spell-checking.

* move descriptions in \note to \details?

* check in SPparameter and SPcontrol if narrowing type 
  conversions are lossless?

* patch sequence.cc to suppress writing to summary.out?

* the interplay of exttpose with BFS is unclear, and 
  there are other switches to boot.

* provide transactions in ruleInduction?

* we need a better organisation of SID and EID. as EID
  can only be integer internally, we need a framwork
  for connecting with POSIXlt, etc.

* as replace methods check the validity of an object
  we should use these.

* we need somthing like all.equal that checks all
  slots but accounts for permutations of labels.

* add a small data set with repetitions of events
  for testing.

* provide read_sequences for symbolic sequences and
  document how to use the current infrastructure with
  it.

CHANGES

o new directories src_exec (in line with src), inst/misc for
  raw data files and stuff [stuff?]

o reworked SPparameter and SPcontrol class to accommodate unset
  parameters (not supplied to a call).
  
o removed underscores from parameter identifiers as these are
  awkward to type. I.M.H.O. it is clear what is what in README.

o sequence and timing information are now silently coerced to
  integer and if this is not possible to factor. as for EID
  a loss of information may make any timing constraints useless
  the user gets a warning.
