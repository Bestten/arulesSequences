NOTE that compiling an empty source file could result in a warning with 
R's default C compiler flags and therefore mmap.o must be omitted from 
the dependencies in Makefile.

For backward compatibility O_BINARY and the replacement of strstream.h 
are restricted to WINDOWS. However, due to compiler warnings we now use
the replacement on all platforms.
