NEWS/ChangeLog for arulesSequences

0.1-4	2008-06-13

    o Adapted to arules-0.6-6.

    o Due to a change in arules the info generic had to be
      replaced by more specific generics.

    o cspade now has a tmpdir argument and provides disk
      usage information.

    o Added support counting for sequences.

    o Added a similarity generic and an implementation
      for sequences.

    o We now restrict the OS-type explicitly to Unix as the
      C functions read, write, and lseek do not work
      properly under Windoze.

    o Adapted to R-2.7.0.
