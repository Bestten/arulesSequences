Steps to install from the package source code tarball:
   - Install the Rtools (see http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/)
     In the following I suppose Rtools are installed in c:\Rtools

   - Launch a Windows command console

   - Set the PATH to have access to Rtools (Unix tools, gcc x86, gcc x64)
     PATH=c:\Rtools\bin;c:\Rtools\MinGW\bin;c:\Rtools\MinGW64\bin;%PATH%

   - If necessary set the PATH to access R, e.g:
     PATH=c:\R-2.14.1\bin;%PATH%

   - If necessary install package 'arules'.

   - Optionally, check the package as follows:
     SET CYGWIN=nodosfilewarning
     R CMD check --no-manual arulesSequences_0.2-x.tar.gz

     There should be no errors and/or warnings.

   - Install the package as follows:
     SET CYGWIN=nodosfilewarning
     R CMD INSTALL arulesSequences_0.2-x.tar.gz
